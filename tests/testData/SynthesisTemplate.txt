ZIF-8 (Zinc Imidazolate Framework-8) was synthesised from two stock solutions: a {S0Mix.Description} and a {S1Mix.Description}.
The {S0Mix.Description} consists of {S0Mix.DetailedDescription}.
The {S1Mix.Description} consists of {S1Mix.DetailedDescription}.
For the reaction mixture, {ReactionMix.DetailedDescription} was injected into a Falcon tube.
The solutions were injected at a rate of {InjectionSpeed.Quantity:.2f~P}, and stirred at 200 rpm for {ReactionTime.Quantity:.2f~P} at an ambient laboratory temperature of {LabTemperature.Quantity:.2f~P}.
